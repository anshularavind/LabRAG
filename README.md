# LabRAG

AI platform acts as a basic biology/biotech laboratory assistant that allows users to ask questions about a particular lab procedure and modify lab procedures based on available equipment. All sources are thoughtfully cited, with the author and the university/laboratory that created the base protocol, making LabRAG a project that maintains the highest standard of ethical and responsible AI.
