1
Seed the cells on glass coverslips (12 mm #1.5) at a concentration of 120,000 cells/well,
and after treatment with DFP for 
24:00:00 , fix in 100% methanol for 
00:20:00
at 
-20 °C .
2
After washing with PBS, block the samples with 5% (v/v) BSA (9048-46-8, Sigma-
Aldrich) diluted in PBS for 
01:00:00  at 
Room temperature .
3
Dilute the primary and secondary antibodies in 5% BSA and incubate for 
01:00:00
at 
Room temperature  with three PBS washing steps in between.
4
Mount the cells on microscopy slides in DAPI Fluoromount-G mounting medium (0100-
20, Southern Biotech), which stains the nuclei, add a cover glass, and store at 
4 °C
until use.
5
Perform the confocal microscopy with a Zeiss LSM700 laser scanning confocal
microscopy with Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.30 Oil DIC, WD 0.21 mm objective or Zeiss
LSM900 with Airyscan 2 confocal super-resolution microscopy with Plan-Apochromat
63×/1.4 Oil DIC, WD 0.19 mm objective.
