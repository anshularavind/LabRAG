Abstract
This protocol summarizes all steps for "deep-sampling" DNA samples extracted from blood that is screened for
presence of Trypanosoma cruzi. Through a combination of careful handling, large 384 well capacity qPCR
instruments, and DNA fragmentation, this protocol allows highly sensitive detection of the agent that causes
Chagas disease.
Guidelines
Contamination Precautions: All steps should be performed in dedicated Biosafety Cabinet. All equipment should
be reserved for this use only and not shared between other projects or areas of the lab.
Spray work surface with 70% ethanol and apply UV light to cabinet at least 15 minutes before beginning work. 
Use LookOut DNA Erase spray to supplement cleaning cabinet surface. 
Using multichannel pipettes is an essential part of contamination control for our protocol. When 384 well plates
are used, pipetting 96 wells at one time is preferred (we like the Integra mini 96). 
All components (primers, probes, itaq mix) for qPCR master mix should be aliquoted into single use tubes when
possible to avoid repeated opening of the same tube. This also prevents multiple freeze/thaw cycles for qPCR
components.
When working with large amounts of T. cruzi DNA - such as when preparing amplification standards- prepare and
process these separately from normal samples.  Processing samples with very high amounts of T. cruzi DNA
(higher than would normally be encountered in host blood) poses a high risk for contamination of other samples,
even when taking all precautions outlined here. Do not extract DNA from high parasite standard samples at the
same time as blood samples being tested for parasite DNA.

Before start
Setting up a dedicated work space inside a Type II Biosafety Cabinet away from common pathogen DNA
producing parts of the lab is key. Using this dedicated clean space and following the contamination prevention
guidelines described in this protocol have enabled us to extract hundreds of DNA samples and run thousands of
pcr reactions while avoiding cross contamination.
Note: See "Guidelines" section of this protocol for more details on contamination prevention.
1. Pre-heat Shake-N-Bake (or similar incubator) to 70°C. 
2. Place 50 mL conical tube of elution buffer in incubator.
3. Turn on cuphorn chiller to pre-chill at 4°C.
4. Prepare all reagents for DNA extraction. Add isopropanol and ethanol to respective buffers as directed in
E.Z.N.A. maxi kit.

1
Take 3-10 mL blood freshly collected in K2EDTA (purple top) blood collection tubes
preserved on ice and centrifuge at 2000 g for 15 minutes to separate plasma from blood
cells.
Note: If blood is previously separated and frozen, thaw completely before starting
extraction.
2
Transfer plasma layer to storage tube(s) with pre-printed labels detailing sample
information and date and store at -80 for use as needed.
3
DNA Extraction Part 1 (Lysis)
3.1
Transfer the cell pellet from blood into a nuclease-free 50 mL conical tube and bring the
volume up to 10mL with PBS
Note: You can use plasma, whole blood, or the cell pellet here but we have found the cell
pellet to be the most sensitive. 
3.2
Add 250 μL Proteinase K solution (included with kit) 
3.3
Vortex to mix well.
Note: Tubes should be tightly closed before vortexing.
3.4
Add 10.2 mL BL Buffer (included with kit).
3.5
Add 20 μL RNase A (Included with kit).
3.6
Vortex to mix thoroughly.
3.7
Incubate at 
70 °C   in Shake-N-Bake incubator for 30 minutes, vortexing the tube
once at the halfway point.  
Note: Shaker platform should be on medium rocking speed during incubation.

Note: Conical tube not provided with kit
4.18
Dry the column further at 
70 °C  for 10 minutes inside the Shake-N-Bake incubator.
4.19
Wipe down the inside of the centrifuge with bleach followed by water to prevent
corrosion. 
Buckets and bucket inserts should also be washed thoroughly during this time. 
Note: This step is important for contamination prevention.
4.20
Add 500 μL HOT (70°C) Elution Buffer (included with kit) directly to the filter inside the
column.
4.21
Let sit at room temperature for 3-5 minutes.
