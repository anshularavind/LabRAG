Abstract
This protocol outlines an assay for measuring the function of plasmid variants in singleplex. 
The inputs include separate E. coli glycerol stocks for each variant. The protocol begins with several growths
which convert the separate glycerol stocks into cultures that have reach stationary phase in a 96-well plate. The
glycerol stocks are first grown overnight in separate tubes. The next morning, the optical density (OD) of each
culture is measured, and then each culture is distributed into a 96-well growth plate. This plate is placed in a plate
reader/incubator to grow to stationary phase (~12 hours) without antibiotics or additives (except those required for
plasmid maintenance). After this point, the cultures are ready to act as an inputs for next growth cycle.
Throughout the subsequent growths, optical density (OD) and fluorescent measurements are recommended to be
taken every 5 minutes and at the end of each growth plate's incubation. The growth cycles are all ~3 hours long,
so that cells stay in mid-log phase. At the end of the last growth cycle, a small amount of the plated cultures act as
input for quantification using a flow-cytometer and fluorescent beads.
Note that unlike the related fitness assays, this assay does not use a selection antibiotic.
Contents of each growth plates 2-3:
Growth plate 2: This growth plate contains additives to initiate gene expression, but no selection antibiotic.
Growth plate 3: This growth plate contains additives to initiate gene expression, but no selection antibiotic.

1
For each variant to be tested, fill a 15 mL snap-cap culture tube with 5 mL of M9 media.
Use a scraping from the glycerol stock for each clonal variant and place into its
culture tube.
2
Incubate cultures overnight (18-24 hours) at 37°C with shaking  at 300 rpm.
3
After incubation, measure the OD600 of each overnight culture as a growth check.
4
Load required reagents (M9 media, additives, PBS, etc.) and growth-plates into
automation system or liquid handler.
5
Prepare first growth plate by pipetting 450 μL M9 media and 50 μL cell culture into each
well.
6
Apply gas-permeable seal to the first growth plate.
7
Incubate for 12 hours at 37°C, with fastest shaking possible in the plate reader (e.g., in
Biotek Neo2SM reader: double orbital shaking at 807 cpm and 1 mm shaking diameter).
Measure OD600 every 5 minutes throughout the incubation. 
Optionally, measure fluorescence if appropriate for the plasmid circuit.
7.1
During incubation, prepare the second growth plate by adding 490 µL mixed media
(media, additives  like inducers, maintenance antibiotics, etc but no selection antibiotic)
per well to the second growth plate. 
7.2
Approximately ten minutes before the end of the 12-hour incubation, pre-warm the
second growth plate. Note: Adjust pre-warming temperature and timing so that the media
temperature in the plate is 37C at the end of the pre-warming, and so that the pre-
warming step ends at the same time as the 12-hour incubation.

8
After 12-hour incubation, remove gas-permeable seal. 
9
Transfer 10 μL from each well of the first growth plate to corresponding wells of the
second growth plate.
There are some subtleties in the 96-channel pipetting required to get a reproducible
transfer, details are described in the SI of this paper:
https://academic.oup.com/synbio/article/7/1/ysac013/6659220 
10
Apply gas-permeable seal to the second growth plate.
11
Incubate the second growth plate for approximately 3 hours at 37°C, with fastest shaking
possible in the plate reader (e.g., in Biotek Neo2SM reader: double orbital shaking at 807
cpm and 1 mm shaking diameter).
The exact incubation time for this step needs to be worked out during the testing
phase. The time needs to be adjusted so that in the wells with the fastest growing
cultures:
1. The cell density always remains in mid-log phase or lower.
2. The cell density at the end of each subsequent incubation step is constant or slightly
decreasing. 
11.1
Measure OD600 and fluorescence every 5 minutes throughout the incubation. 
Use excitation and emission wavelengths appropriate for the fluorescent protein used
in the plasmid system.
11.2
During incubation, prepare the third growth plate by adding 450 µL mixed media  (media,
additives  like inducers, maintenance antibiotics, etc but no selection antibiotic) per well
to the third growth plate. 
11.3
Approximately ten minutes before the end of the 3-hour incubation, pre-warm the third
growth plate. Note: Adjust pre-warming temperature and timing so that the media
temperature in the plate is 37C at the end of the pre-warming, and so that the pre-
warming step ends at the same time as the 3-hour incubation.
12
After incubation, remove gas-permeable seal from the second growth plate and measure
end-point OD600.
13
Transfer 50 μL from each well of the second growth plate to corresponding wells of the
third growth plate.

14
Apply gas-permeable seal to the third growth plate.
15
Incubate the third growth plate for approximately 3 hours at 37°C, with fastest shaking
possible in the plate reader (e.g., in Biotek Neo2SM reader: double orbital shaking at 807
cpm and 1 mm shaking diameter). 
Use the same timing as calculated for the second growth plate.
15.1
Measure OD600 and fluorescence every 5 minutes throughout the incubation. 
Use excitation and emission wavelengths appropriate for the fluorescent protein used
in the plasmid system.
16
After incubation, remove gas-permeable seal from the third growth plate and perform the
quantitative function measurements using one of the following options (Flow Cytometer
or Plate Reader).
17
Transfer 5 μl of each cell sample to a well in a round-bottom 96-well plate containing 195 
μl of PBS supplemented with 170 μg/mL chloramphenicol. 
Note: Chloramphenicol is added to the PBS to halt production of new proteins in the E.
coli cells to give a more stable fluorescence measurement, since it can take over one
hour to measure all of the samples. 
18
Measure the fluorescence of the cells containing the selection plasmid on a flow
cytometer equipped with a 96-well plate autosampler using an excitation wavelength and
emission filter appropriate for the fluorescent protein in the plasmid. 
Use fluorescence calibration beads with each batch of samples to facilitate the
calibration of flow cytometry data to molecules of equivalent fluorophore. 
Use automated gating to distinguish cell events and singlet cell events from other
background events for each sample measured with cytometry, with the same gating
strategy applied to fluorescent and non-fluorescent control cells.
19
Measure the fluorescence background usin a non-fluorescent control (i.e., E. coli cells of
the same strain with a plasmid that is similar to the selection plasmid, but with no
fluorescent protein).

20
Calculate the mean fluorescence signal of the singlet cell events for all measurements of
the non-fluorescent control cells. This is the background signal.
21
Calculate the mean fluorescence signal of the singlet cell events for each sample
measured with the (fluorescent) selection plasmid.
22
For each sample, the quantitative Function is the mean fluorescence for that sample with
the background signal subtracted.
