Abstract
This protocol describes isolation of nuclei from brain tissues of 10-week-old B6J and CASTJ mice, preparation of
a single nucleus suspension, selection for nuclei using Miltenyi Biotec’s Anti-Nucleus MicroBeads, and fixation for
SHARE-seq using part of the Broad Institute protocol. We processed 8 samples at once (2 males and 2 females
per strain) with two technicians in parallel. This protocol takes about 3 hours from start to finish. We have
successfully tested this protocol with mouse brain cortex (either left or right side) and diencephalon
(thalamus+hypothalamus)+pituitary.

Guidelines
1. Buffers can be prepared ahead of time and kept in 4°C. Add RNase inhibitors fresh the day of the experiment.
2. We recommend using a 5 mL pipette for aspirations and resuspensions > 1 mL.
3. Record everything in SHARE spreadsheet.

Before starting, spray down the bench and pipettes with 70% ethanol and RNase-away. 
3
Coat SHARE-seq nuclei prep tubes with BSA. Fill 1.5 mL tubes with 1.5 mL 1% BSA-DEPC
and incubate for 30 minutes. After incubation, aspirate BSA solution and dry for 30
minutes. Store at 4°C. Alternatively, add 150 uL 7.5% BSA, vortex, remove supernatant,
let tube sit on ice briefly, and aspirate BSA solution.
4
Pre-chill centrifuge to 4°C.
5

8
Prepare two 25 mL aliquots of HDT-2RI in 50 mL conical tubes. Keep one at room
temperature and the other on ice.

10
Prepare a fresh 2.5M glycine solution (usable for up to one month). Weigh the glycine

in a thermomixer.
11

14
Drop whole frozen tissue into a chilled gentleMACS C Tube with 2 mL lysis buffer. Close
tubes firmly and invert immediately, ensuring tissue is not stuck to the bottom or side.
Keep tubes on ice and proceed immediately to dissociation.
15
Run the gentleMACS Program 4C_nuclei_1 on the Octo Dissociator (~5 minutes). Add
chilled adapters to make sure nuclei stay cold.
16
Remove tubes, ensuring tissue did not get stuck on the sides, and spin down in a 4°C
centrifuge for ~10 seconds to bring liquid to the bottom, then place tubes back on ice.
17
Filter nuclei suspension through 70 um MACS SmartStrainer into a 5 mL tube. Fit a tube
rack in ice for extra stability while filtering.
18
Wash 70 um MACS SmartStrainer with 2 mL additional lysis buffer. Add 2 mL to C tubes,
cap, and swish to recover any nuclei stuck to the sides and cap of the C tubes, then
wash the strainer.
19
Discard strainer and centrifuge the nuclei suspension at 4°C, 350g for 5 minutes. 
20
Resuspend nuclei pellet in 3 mL RSB.
21
Filter nuclei suspension through 30 um MACS SmartStrainer into a labeled 5 mL tube.
22
Count nuclei. Use 1:11 dilution factor, 20 uL dye + 2 uL sample.
23
Set aside 4 million nuclei in RSB in a new 5 mL tube and spin down at 4°C, 300g for 5
minutes.
24
Pipette off supernatant completely without disturbing the nucleus pellet
25
Resuspend nucleus pellet in 1.8 mL NSB-RI.
(450 µL of nuclei separation buffer per 10⁶ total nuclei)
Anti-Nucleus MicroBeads selection

26
Add 200 uL of Anti-Nucleus MicroBeads
(50 µL of Anti-Nucleus MicroBeads per 10⁶ total nuclei)
27
Mix well and incubate for 15 minutes in the refrigerator (2−8°C). 
28
During incubation, prepare LS columns (need 1 column per sample):
Place column in the magnetic field of a suitable MACS Separator.
1. Label LS columns, 15 mL tubes for debris, and 5 mL tubes for nuclei.
2. Place LS columns in the magnetic separator rack and 15 mL tubes in the clear plastic
tube holder.
3. Rinse the columns by passing 1 mL NSB (no RI) 3 times (3 mL total) with a 10 mL
serological pipette. Wait the first mL pass through, no dripping, then add the next mL
29
Add 2 mL NSB-RI to the samples and proceed to magnetic separation with LS Columns. 
30
Apply nucleus suspension onto the column, 1 mL at a time. Collect flowthrough
containing debris in the 15 mL tubes. Add the nucleus suspension directly to the center
of the column reservoir. Always wait until the column reservoir is empty before
proceeding to the next step.
31
Wash column two times with 1 mL NSB-RI. Collect debris that passes through and
combine with the flow-through from the previous step. Perform washing steps by adding
buffer aliquots as soon as the column reservoir is empty. Use buffer to rinse the inner
column walls.
32
Remove column from the separator and place it on a 5 mL collection tube. Typically just
hold it over the 5 mL tube with one hand.
33
With the other hand, pipette 1 mL NSB-RI onto the column. Immediately flush out the
magnetically labeled nuclei by firmly pushing the plunger into the column. 
34
Optionally, count nuclei to measure recovery after bead cleanup. Start the 5 minute spin
in the next section and count then; if necessary, finish during the 10 minute incubation at
step 4 in the next section. Use 1:4 dilution factor (9 uL dye + 3 uL sample).
35
Spin down nuclei in the 5 mL collection tubes at 4°C, 750g for 5 minutes.

36
Remove supernatant and resuspend nuclei pellet in 4 mL room temperature HDT-2RI.
Transfer tube to a room temperature rack.
37
At RT, add 53.4 uL of methanol-free formaldehyde in the fume hood (16% stock
solution). Final concentration for nuclei: 0.2%. Close tube and nutate or rotate nuclei at
RT for 5 minutes.
38
To quench fixation, per reaction, add 224.4 uL fresh 2.5M Glycine, 200 uL of 1M Tris pH
8.0, 53.2 uL of 7.5% BSA, and mix using a pipette. Incubate on ice for 10 minutes.
39
Spin 750g, 4°C, 5 minutes. Gently remove supernatant.
40
Add 500 uL of HDT-2RI and gently resuspend pellet. Transfer to labeled 1.5 mL tube.
Store on ice.
a. Count nuclei at 1:10 dilution factor (18 uL dye + 2 uL sample)
b. For multiple aliquots, split 500 uL into 2 tubes of 250 uL.
41
Spin 750xg, 4°C, 10 minutes. Gently remove supernatant. Remove all fluid and freeze at
-80C as a dry pellet.
