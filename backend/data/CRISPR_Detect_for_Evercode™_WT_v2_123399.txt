Abstract
CRISPR Detect enables analysis of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) in studies using CROP-seq or
similar methods. Compatible methods generate a polyadenylated transcript containing the sgRNA
sequence downstream of a human U6 promoter. When CRISPR Detect is combined with Evercode
WT v2, paired sgRNA detection and whole transcriptome expression can be analyzed in up to
100,000 cells across up to 48 different biological samples or experimental conditions.
Evercode Cell Fixation kits convert the cells into individualized reaction compartments, thus avoiding
the requirement for dedicated microfluids hardware. Through three rounds of barcoding, the
transcriptome of each fixed cell is uniquely labeled. In each round, pooled cells are randomly
distributed into different wells, and transcripts are labeled with well-specific barcodes. During cDNA
amplification, barcoded transcripts are amplified, and sgRNA containing polyadenylated transcripts
are enriched with human U6 specific primers. Amplified cDNA is split to create Whole Transcriptome
and CRISPR sequencing libraries. After sequencing, the Parse Biosciences Analysis Pipeline
assigns reads that share the same four barcode combination to a single cell and associates sgRNAs
to the appropriate cell. For additional details on the molecular mechanisms core to the Evercode and
CRISPR Detect technology, see Appendix B.

Before start
User Supplied Equipment and Consumables: Before starting an experiment, check the "User Supplied Equipment and Consumables" section and
confirm that your lab has all of the supplies that are not provided by the kit. Avoid substituting custom materials for those that are provided in the kit.
Each item has been deliberately chosen to attain optimal results.
Avoiding RNase Contamination: Standard precautions should be taken to avoid introducing RNases into samples or reagents throughout the
workflow. Always wear proper laboratory gloves and use aseptic technique. RNases are not inactivated by ethanol or isopropanol, but can be
inactivated by specific products such as RNaseZap RNase Decontamination Solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific). These can be sprayed on
benchtops and used to clean pipette. It is recommended to use pre-sterilized, filter pipette tips to reduce RNase contamination from pipettes.
Centrifuges: Use a swinging bucket centrifuge for all high speed spin steps in this protocol. Use of a fixed-angle centrifuge will lead to substantial
cell loss. Although the recommended centrifugation speeds are appropriate for most sample types, they can be adjusted to improve retention.
Centrifuge Tubes: Ensure that the tubes will be used are polypropylene and not polystyrene. Polystyrene tubes will lead to substantial cell loss.
Sample Handling: It is critical that cells are thoroughly resuspended after centrifugation. Resuspend cells by slowly (to prevent mechanical
damage) and repeatedly pipetting up and down until no clumps are visible. Wide bore pipette tips are not recommended as they make it difficult to
adequately resuspend cell pellets. Due to cell adherence to tubes, it is recommended to carefully pipette along the bottom and sides of the
centrifuge tubes to minimize cell loss.
Sample Loading Table: The "WT Mega - Sample Loading Table V1.2.0" (Excel spreadsheet) should be completed before starting the experimental
workflow. If not working properly, ensure that the Macros are enabled in the Sample Loading Table. Be sure to only edit the colored cells on the
table to avoid disturbing the necessary formatting.
Maximizing Cell Retention During Pooling Steps: During the barcoding steps, some cells may stick to the side of the wells in the 96-well plates. To
increase cell retention, it is important to pipette up and down several times in each well before removing and pooling cells. Note that additional
pipetting may lead to increased bubbles while pooling. While bubbles will not affect results, we advise using caution when pipetting to prevent
excess bubble formation and maintain experimental ease. We recommend the following procedure when pooling:
Set the multichannel P200 to 10 µL less than the volume in each well. The volumes for Barcoding Rounds 1, 2, and 3 should be 30 µL, 50 µL, and
70 µL, respectively. This will avoid bubbles while pipetting up and down.
Insert tips into the bottom of the wells. Pipette up and down 3x in the middle of the well, then pipette up and down 3x on the front side of the
well, followed by 3x on the back side of the well, before proceeding with pooling cells.
Pool any remaining liquid left in the wells (should be ~10 µL).
Sealing Plates in Original Container: There are multiple steps requiring the removal and application of seals to 96-well plates. In either motion,
ensure that the plate is in its original container for best support. Failure to do so may result in plate slippage and loss, or swapping, of liquid
between wells.
Cell Strainers: A 40 µm cell strainer will be used in multiple steps. To maximize cell retention, press the pipette tip directly against the stainer.
Ensure that ample pressure is applied to hold contact between the tip and the strainer to force liquid through in ~1 second. For cells larger than 40
µm, the 40 µm strainer should be replaced throughout the protocol with the appropriate size mesh (70 µm or 100 µm).
Lysis Buffer Precipitate: Ensure that there is no precipitate when using the 2x Lysis Buffer. Warming the 2x Lysis Buffer at 37C for 5 minutes should
resolubilize solution. If precipitate remains, warm 2x Lysis buffer at 37C for another 5 minutes.
Sequencing Libraries: Multiple sequencing libraries can be prepared from the same experiment. At the end of barcoding (Section 1), the recovered
cells can be split across different sublibraries. The number of cells to be sequenced is determined when cells are divided into sublibraries at the
lysis step. Thus, not all of the cells prepared in these steps must be sequenced together.

1.1: Experimental Setup
1.1
Prepare for the first round of barcoding with the following checklist:
Each sample should have been counted after nuclei fixation and recorded on the
spreadsheet in order to calculate volumes to normalize concentrations to 2,500
cells/nuclei per ul. Adjust target volumes as necessary depending on the volume
needed in the final plate(s).
At least a day ahead of the experiment, distribute dilution buffer in a new sample
normalization plate one well at a time (NOT the actual barcoding plate) and store at
-20C.
On the day of the experiment, take out sample normalization plate and thaw at room
temperature. Centrifuge the plate at 100 x g for 1 minute and place on ice. 
Set your swinging bucket centrifuge to 4C.
Prepare a 37C water bath.
Fill some ice buckets, enough to hold 3 96-well plates and several tubes.

1.2: Sample Counting and Loading Setup
2.1
Thaw the fixed cell samples in a 37C water bath until all ice crystals dissolve, then place
on ice. It is important to fully thaw samples before placing on ice.
2.2
Arrange samples in desired order in 1.5 mL plate racks on ice. 
Critical! Double-check order of samples matches the order on the spreadsheet.
2.3
Note: This step requires a new box of 20 µl tips.
Using a Move-it multichannel pipette with adjustable spacer, pipette fixed nuclei/cells
from 1.5 mL tubes to sample normalization plate. Should be same volume across entire
plate. When pipetting cells/nuclei, mix gently by pipetting up and down when taking
cells/nuclei and again when dispensing.

1.3: Reverse Transcription Barcoding
During this section, cDNA will be reverse transcribed from RNA with barcoded RT
primers specific to each well. 
3.1
Gently remove the Round 1 Plate from the thermocycler and place into the original green
plastic plate holder. Centrifuge the plate at 100 x g for 1 minute.
3.2
Place the plate (and holder) on a flat surface and remove the plastic seal. Store on ice.
Note: Plate seals may be difficult to remove. Carefully peel the plate seal while applying
downward pressure to keep the plates from moving (to minimize cross-contamination of
wells).
3.3
Add diluted samples to wells in the Round 1 Plate.
Note: To prevent sample loss, mix cells as indicated below. Additionally, this step
requires a new box of 20 µl tips.
Follow the Sample Loading Table during this step to determine which samples to add to
each well. Using a multichannel pipette, add 15 µl nuclei/cells from the sample
normalization plate to each of the 96 wells in the Round 1 Plate. Immediately after
dispensing cells, mix gently by pipetting up and down exactly 3x. When pipetting the
same sample into many wells, the same sample should be periodically mixed by gentle
pipetting to avoid cells settling. Do not vortex your cells.
Critical! Different tips must be used when pipetting cells into the 96-well plate. Never
place a tip that has entered one of the 96 wells into a different well. 
3.4
Remove the Round 1 Plate and holder from the ice bucket and place on a flat surface.
Seal the Round 1 Plate with an additional 96-well plate seal cover.
Note: Plate sealer is included in the Accessories box.

transferring the volume of the rows to Row A or Row E. Recover residual liquid across
rows B-D and F-H using the multichannel pipette set to 10 µL. Next, pipette the total
volume in Row A up and down 3x, then transfer the total volume of each well in Row A
into the same 15 mL centrifuge tube with a single channel P200 pipette set to 200 µL. Do
the same with Row E. Do not be concerned if there are a few µL of residual volume in the
wells after pooling. 
Note: Bubbles may form while pooling. They will not affect the quality of the experiment.
Critical! Do NOT pool all eight rows into a single row or the liquid may overflow. Keep the
Round 1 Plate and the 15 mL falcon tube with pooled cells on ice during the pooling step.
3.10
Discard the Round 1 Plate.
3.11
Add 19.2 µL of Spin Additive to the 15 mL tube with pooled cells. Gently invert the tube
once to mix. 
Critical! Do NOT discard the Spin Additive as it will be needed in another step.
3.12
Centrifuge the pooled cells in a swinging bucket centrifuge cooled to 4C for 10 minutes
at 200 x g.
Critical! Move to the next step as soon as the centrifuge finishes and handle the tube
gently to avoid dislodging the cell pellet. Waiting too long to aspirate supernatant
increases the risk of dislodging the pellet.
3.13
Using a P1000 pipette for the first 3 mL, then a P200 pipette for remaining volume,
aspirate supernatant such that about ~40 µL of liquid remains above the pellet. Do not
disturb the pellet. Depending on the number of starting cells and cell types, the pellet
may not be visible.
3.14
Note: To prevent substantial cell loss during resuspension, see "Sample Handling" in
Notes Before Starting.
Gently resuspend cells with 1 mL of Resuspension Buffer. Once cells are fully
resuspended, add an additional 1 mL  of Resuspension Buffer to make a total volume of
2 mL. Keep this solution on ice and proceed to Ligation Barcoding.

Note: Plate seals may be difficult to remove. Carefully peel the plate seal while applying
downward pressure to keep the plates from moving (to minimize cross-contamination of
wells).
4.5
Using a P1000 pipette, add the entirety of cells in the Ligation Mix + Enzyme to a basin.
4.6
Add pooled cells to the Round 2 Plate.
Note: To prevent sample loss, mix cells as indicated below. Additionally, this step
requires a new box of 200 µL tips.
Using a multichannel P200 pipette, add 40 µL of mix in the basin to each of the 96 wells
in the Round 2 Plate. As you add the 40 µL to each well, pipette up and down exactly 2x
to ensure proper mixing. To avoid cells settling in the basin, also gently pipette up and
down 2x with the multichannel pipette in the basin before transferring the cells from the
basin to each row.
Note: Using a single channel pipette and tilting the basin may be required to fill the last
row if volume in the basin is low. If volume is insufficient to fill every well, a few wells can
be left empty without impacting experimental results.
Critical! Different tips must be used when pipetting cells into the 96-well plate. Never
place a tip that has entered one of the 96 wells back into the basin.

Pool all wells from the Round 2 Plate into a new basin. 
Note: Proper mixing is required to prevent substantial cell loss during pooling. See
"Maximizing Cell Retention During Pooling Steps" in Notes Before Starting.
With the multichannel pipette set to 50 µL, pool volume from each well into a new basin.
To maximize cell retention while pooling, pipette up and down 3x in the middle of the
well, 3x on the front sides of the well, and 3x on the back side of the well before
transferring the volume of rows A-H to the basin. Recover residual liquid across all rows
using the multichannel pipette. Do not be concerned if there are a few µL of residual
volume in the wells after pooling.
Note: Bubbles may form while pooling. They will not affect the quality of the experiment.
4.18
Discard the Round 2 Plate.
4.19
Remove the 40 µm strainer from the packaging and carefully hold the strainer using the
outside casing without touching the mesh. Using a P1000 pipette set to 1000 µL, pass all
cells from this basin through the 40 µm strainer into a new basin. Mix cells in the basin
between passages. The original basin must be tilted in order to pipette the final volume.
Note: For cells larger than 40 µm, the 40 µm strainer should be replaced throughout the
protocol with the appropriate size mesh (70 µm or 100 µm). Additionally, bubbles may
form while straining. They will not affect the quality of the experiment.
Critical! To ensure that all of the liquid passes through the strainer, press the tip of the
pipette against the filter and press the pipette plunger down steadily. All of the liquid
should pass through the strainer in ~1 second.
4.20
Add 20 µL of Round 3 Ligation Enzyme to the basin with the strained cells and mix by
gently pipetting up and down ~20x with a P1000 pipette set to 1000 µL.
4.21
Transfer the Round 3 Plate from the thermocycler back to its original orange plate holder.
Centrifuge the plate at 100 x g for 1 minute. Plate the plate (and holder) on a flat surface
and remove the seal. Keep at room temperature.
Note: Plate seals may be difficult to remove. Carefully peel the plate seal while applying
downward pressure the keep the plates from moving (to minimize cross-contamination
of wells).

Note: To prevent sample loss, mix cells as indicated below. Additionally, this step
requires a new box of 200 µL tips.
Using a multichannel P200 pipette, add 50 µL of mix in the basin to each of the 96 wells
in the Round 3 Plate. As you add the 50 µL to each well, pipette up and down exactly 2x
to ensure proper mixing. To avoid cells settling in the basin, also gently pipette up and
down 2x with the multichannel pipette in the basin before transferring the cells from the
basin to each row.
Note: Using a single channel pipette and tilting the basin may be required to fill the last
row if volume in the basin is low. If volume is insufficient to fill every well, a few wells can
be left empty without impacting experimental results.
Critical! Different tips must be used when pipetting cells into the 96-well plate. Never
place a tip that has entered one of the 96 wells back into the basin.

5.8
Note: To prevent substantial cell loss during resuspension, see "Sample Handling" in

Using a P200 pipette, gently resuspend the pellet with an additional 200 µL of Dilution
Buffer, bringing the final volume to ~240 µL. When resuspending the pellet, pipette
slowly to prevent mechanical damage to cells. Keep tubes on ice.
Critical! Do NOT discard Dilution Buffer as it will be needed in another step.
5.9
Using a P200 pipette set to 200 µL, gently pipette up and down the 5x and immediately
use 5 µL of the mixed cells to count using a hemocytometer. Keep the 15 mL tube on ice.
Note: When using a hemocytometer, dilute 5 µL of the mixed cell solution into 5 µL of
Trypan Blue or DAPI. Mix well and load onto the hemocytometer. Some level of debris is
normal at this step. Alternatively, cells can be counted via flow cytometry, but using a
hemocytometer is strongly recommended. 
Choosing Sublibrary SIzes: In the following step, cells will be aliquoted into different
sublibraries that will be prepared for sequencing. At the end of the library prep, each
sublibrary will have its own sublibrary index, making it possible to sequence each
sublibrary with different numbers of reads. It is also possible to add different numbers of
cells to each sublibrary. In practice it can be useful to have at least one sublibrary with
very few cells (200-500) that can be sequenced deeply (>50,000 reads per cells) with a
limited number of overall reads. This sublibrary then provides a good estimate of gene
and transcript detection per cell that would be expected if the other sublibraries were
also sequenced deeply. The maximum number of cells that can eventually be sequenced
will be the sum of the number of cells across all sublibraries.
We slightly overload 15 subpools with 67,000 cells/nuclei and one subpool with 13,000
cells/nuclei for exome capture and long read sequencing. Any extra barcoded
cells/nuclei are distributed in additional 67,000 aliquots and kept at -80C.
5.10
Determine sublibrary size(s) and dilutions. Up to 16 sublibraries, of varying sizes, can
be made. Use the "Sublibrary Generation Table" (Appendix A) to determine the volume
of cells and Dilution Buffer to add to each sublibrary (dependent on desired sublibrary
size and the concentration of cells measured in the previous step). Give each sublibrary
a unique label. Make sure to record which sublibrary sizes correspond to what labels.
Label both the top and side of the PCR tube with those labels. 
Critical! Do NOT overload a sublibrary. 62,500 cells/sublibrary is the maximum.
Overloading a sublibrary lysate with too many cells will result in increased doublets.
5.11
Using a P200 pipette set to 200 µL, gently pipette up and down 5x. Aliquot the
determined volume of cells (from the previous step) to each correctly labelled sublibrary
PCR tube and add Dilution Buffer to bring to total volume to 25 µL. Between each
aliquot, gently pipette mix the cells to avoid settling. Store sublibraries on ice.
5.12
Make a Lysis Master Mix. Ensure there is no precipitate present in the 2x Lysis Buffer.
Add 440 µL of 2x Lysis Buffer to 88 µL of Lysis Enzyme in a 1.5 mL tube.
Critical! Do NOT place Lysis Master Mix on ice, as a precipitate will form.
5.13
Add Lysis Master Mix to sublibraries. Add 30 µL of Lysis Master Mix to each tube,
bringing the total volume to 55 µL. Keep sublibraries at room temperature.
5.14
Vortex samples for 10 sec to initiate lysis. Be sure to keep caps closed on tubes. Briefly
centrifuge tubes (~2 sec).

2.2 Applying Binder Beads to Sublibrary Lysates
7.1
Remove the desired sublibrary lysates from the -80C freezer and incubate at 37C for 5
minutes, ensuring that no precipitate is present before proceeding. If precipitate is still
present, incubate at 37C for 5 more minutes.
7.2
Briefly centrifuge sublibrary lysates (~ 2 sec).
7.3
Lightly centrifuge the Lysis Neutralizer, mix gently with a pipette, and add 2.5 µL to
each sublibrary lysate. Place tubes into a 96-well plastic plate holder (press tubes
securely into holder) and put plate holder lid back on. Vortex the plastic holder on 10 (or
equivalent max setting) for 1 minute. Remove tubes from plate holder. Briefly centrifuge
(~2 sec), and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes.
7.4
Add Binder Beads to sublibrary lysates. First mix the Binder Beads suspended in Bind
Buffer A by pipetting up and down. Then add 50 µL to each sublibrary lysate without
pipette mixing the lysates. Place tubes in a plastic plate holder (press tubes securely into
holder) and put plate holder lid back on. Vortex plastic holder on 10 (or equivalent max
setting) for 1 minute. Discard the tube with any excess Binder Beads.
Critical! After adding beads to sublibrary lysates, mix by vortexing and not by pipetting.
7.5
Agitate the sublibrary lysates with Binder Beads at room temperature for 60 minutes.
Place the tubes in a 96-well plastic plate holder (press tubes securely into the holder)
with the lid on and then put the plastic holder into a foam attachment for a vortexer.
Vortex on 2 (out of 10) for the duration of the 60 minute incubation (~800-1000 RPM).
7.6
Take the tubes off of the vortexer (beads may have settled somewhat). Vortex briefly (~5
sec) and then briefly centrifuge (~1 sec) without letting beads collect at the bottom of the
tubes.
7.7
Place the tubes against a magnetic rack (for 0.2 mL tubes) on the high position (with
magnets closest to the top) and wait for all the beads to bind to the magnet (~2 min).
Critical! The supernatant should be clear before proceeding. The cDNA is unamplified at
this step, so discarding any beads in the supernatant will result in a reduction of
transcripts and genes detected per cell.
7.8
Remove the clear supernatant with a pipette and discard, while still keeping the tubes in
the magnetic rack.
7.9
Remove tubes from the magnetic rack and resuspend beads with 125 µL of Bind Buffer
B. 
7.10
Keep tubes at room temperature for 1 minute.
7.11
Place the tubes against a magnetic rack on the high position and wait for all the beads to
bind to the magnet (~2 min; liquid should be clear).

Using a pipette, aspirate and discard the ethanol from each tube (it may be necessary to
remove the final few drops with a P20 pipette). With the tube still on the rack, air dry the
beads (~2 min).
Critical! Do NOT over-dry the beads. Over-drying of beads can lead to substantial losses
in yield. "Cracking" of the beads is a sign of over-drying.
10.14
Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack and resuspend beads from each tube in 25 µL
of molecular biology grade water.
10.15
Incubate the tubes at 37C for 10 minutes to maximize elution of amplified cDNA.
10.16
Place the tubes against a magnetic rack on the low position (with magnets closest to the
bottom) and wait for all the beads to bind to the magnet (~2 min: liquid should be clear).
10.17
Transfer 25 µL of the eluted DNA into new PCR tubes with a P200 pipette. Discard the
tubes with the SPRI beads. The amplified cDNA is now ready to be quantified.
Note: Label the new PCR tubes as cDNA to avoid confusion in subsequent steps.
10.18
Measure the concentration of the cDNA using the Qubit dsDNA HS protocol.
Note: Be sure to record sample concentrations as they will be needed for further
downstream steps (Section 3.5: Sublibrary Index PCR).
10.19
Run 1 µL of the cDNA on a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation. Use the concentration obtained
from the Qubit to determine the appropriate dilution necessary (check manufacturer
specifications, 1:10 dilution is generally appropriate). See Figure 1 for the expected cDNA
size distribution.
Note: The traces above are representative of typical Bioanalyzer and TapeStation cDNA
traces. The shape and prominence of the trace is dependent on cell type, sublibrary size,

Multiple thermocyclers may be needed for this section depending on the amount
ofcDNA added to each sublibrary during the fragmentation reaction. Refer to the step
3.5.6.
16.1
Ensure that each well of the UDI Plate - WT is properly thawed. Centrifuge the plate at 
100 x g for 1 minute.
Critical! Double-check the label on the plate as specific plates are used in different
protocols.
16.2
Thoroughly wipe the UDI Plate - WT seal with 70% ethanol and allow it to dry completely.
Note: Before proceeding, ensure the UDI Plate is properly orientated. The notched corner
should be in the bottom left (see image on the right). Only wells from columns 1-6, and
only one well/sublibrary can be used.
16.3
Add well-specific index primers from the UDI Plate - WT to your sublibraries as follows:
Using a multichannel P20 pipette set to 4 μL, pierce new, unused wells of the UDI Plate -
WT. Mix 5x then transfer 4 μL of the index primer solution into your sublibraries.
Note: Ensure that no two sublibraries contain index primers from the same well. To
minimize cross-contamination, use a new pipette tip for each sublibrary and avoid
splashing or mixing the liquid between individual wells.
For each sublibrary, record the UDI Plate - WT's well position (e.g., 'A1', 'B1') and
sublibrary index ID (see Section 4.1) for sequencing and demultiplexing purposes.
16.4
If the UDI Plate - WT has unused wells, store it at -20°C for future use.
16.5
Add 25 µL of the Index PCR Mix to each sublibrary, bringing the total volume to 50 µL.
Pipette up and down 10x with the pipette set to 25 µL to ensure proper mixing, followed
by brief centrifugation (~2 sec).
Critical! Different tips must be used when pipetting Index PCR Mix into each sublibrary.
Never place a tip that has entered a sublibrary back into the Index PCR Mix.
16.6
Place the sample(s) into a thermocycler and run the program below. The number of

remove the final few drops with a P20 pipette). With the tube still on the rack, air dry the
beads (~2 min).
Critical! Do NOT over-dry the beads. Over-drying of beads can lead to substantial losses
in yield. "Cracking" of the beads is a sign of over-drying.
17.14
Remove the tubes from the magnetic rack and resuspend beads from each tube in 20 µL
of molecular biology grade water.
17.15
Incubate the tubes at room temperature for 5 minutes to elute DNA.
17.16
Place the tubes against a magnetic rack on the low position (with magnets closest to the
bottom) and wait for all the beads to bind to the magnet (~2 min: liquid should be clear).
17.17
Transfer the eluted DNA into new PCR tubes. Discard the tubes with the SPRI beads. The
products are now ready to be quantified for sequencing.
17.18
Measure the concentration of the fragmented DNA using the Qubit dsDNA HS protocol.
17.19
Run 1 µL of the DNA on a Bioanalyzer or TapeStation. Use the concentration obtained
from the Qubit to determine the appropriate dilution necessary (check manufacturer
specifications, 1:10 dilution is generally appropriate). There should be a peak between
400-500 bp. See Figure 2 (next page) for the expected DNA size distribution.

Note: The traces above are representative of typical Bioanalyzer and TapeStation from
indexed sublibraries. There should be a peak between 400-500 bp. The prominence of
the trace is dependent on amount of DNA loaded into the Bioanalzyer or TapeStation.
Sublibraries with minor deviations can still produce high quality data.
Bioanalyzer Note: There may be an additional peak present on the Bioanalyzer. This
typically occurs if products are overamplified, but should not impact sequencing or data
quality (assuming there is still a peak present at 400-500bp). Do not use this additional
peak when estimating amplicon size.

Setup
- Prepare ~1.2 mL 85% ethanol per sublibrary (e.g. 2.4 mL for 2 sublibraries).
- Fill an ice bucket.
- Take out the Parse Biosciences magnetic rack for 0.2 mL PCR tubes.
- Ensure you have at least 88 μL of SPRI beads (Ampure XP or KAPA Pure Beads)
per sublibrary. These will be used throughout Section 4.
- Obtain recorded cDNA concentrations from step 2.5.18.
18.2
-Obtain amplified cDNA from step 2.5.20. Ensure the caps are closed then vortex (2-3
sec).
Briefly centrifuge tubes (~2 sec).
Note: Keep these tubes on ice.
-For each CRISPR sublibrary, aliquot out 50 ng of cDNA into a new PCR strip tube. If the

concentration of cDNA is higher than 25 ng/μL, a dilution is recommended to ensure
sufficient volume is used while pipetting (at least 2 μL used). Bring the total volume of
each
tube to 21 µL using molecular biology grade water and place back on ice. Store any
remaining cDNA at -20°C to be used for future experiments.
Note: If you have less than 50 ng of cDNA after Whole Transcriptome Library Preparation
for a given sublibrary, use all remaining cDNA at this step. If the input greater than 5 ng/
µL,
the quality of the library is unlikely to be affected. Record the amount added to each tube
as
subsequent PCR cycles will have to be adjusted based on cDNA concentration (See
Appendix D for more details).
-Make the CRISPR PCR Reaction Solution in the order shown below. Ensure that all rea-
gents are fully thawed and mixed well before using. Mix the CRISPR PCR Reaction
Solution by pipetting 10x and store on ice.

-Obtain amplified CRISPR sublibraries from step 4.2.19. Ensure the caps are closed then
vortex (2-3 sec). Briefly centrifuge tubes (~2 sec).
Note: Keep these tubes on ice.
-Aliquot 10 ng of each amplified CRISPR sublibrary into a new PCR strip tube. Bring the
total volume of each tube to 21 µL using molecular biology grade water and place on ice.
Store any remaining product from Section 4.2 at -20°C to be used for future
experiments.
Note: If you have less than 10 ng of input for a given sublibrary, add the entire amount of
cDNA at this step. This is unlikely to affect the library quality. Record the amount added
to
each tube as subsequent PCR cycles will have to be adjusted based on cDNA
concentration (See Appendix D for more details).
-Ensure that each well of the UDI Plate - EC is properly thawed. Centrifuge the plate at
100 x g for 1 minute.
CRITICAL! Ensure not to confuse UDI plates. Double-check the label on the plate as
specific
plates are used in different sections.
-Thoroughly wipe the UDI Plate - EC seal with 70% ethanol and allow it to dry
completely.
Note: Before proceeding, ensure the UDI Plate is properly orientated. The notched corner
should be
in the bottom left (see image on the right). Only wells from columns 1-6 can be used.
20.2
- Add well-specific index primers from the UDI Plate - EC to each sublibraries as follows:
- Using a multichannel P20 pipette set to 4 μL, pierce new, unused wells of the
UDI Plate - EC. Mix 5x then transfer 4 μL of the index primer solution into your
sublibraries.
Note: Ensure that no two sublibraries contain index primers from the same well.
To minimize cross-contamination, use a new pipette tip for each sublibrary and
avoid splashing or mixing the liquid between individual wells.
- For each sublibrary, record the UDI Plate - EC's well position (e.g., 'A1', 'B1') and
sublibrary index ID (see Section 5.3: Unique Dual Index (UDI) Plate - EC
Sequences) for sequencing and demultiplexing purposes.

Multiple thermocyclers may be needed for this section depending on the amount of
cDNA added to each sublibrary during the fragmentation reaction. Refer to step next
page to determine how many thermocyclers are needed.

Using a new 1.5 mL tube, combine the Universal Index Primer and Index Primer Mix to
make the Sublibrary Amplification Mix. Mix well by pipetting and store on ice.

Add 2 μL of different index primers to each sublibrary ensuring that no two sublibraries
contain the same sublibrary index primer. Make sure to record which sublibrary contains
which index primer.
26.3
Add 27 μL Sublibrary Amplification Mix to the 23 μL sublibrary from the previous step.
Pipette up and down 10x with the pipette set to 27 μL to ensure proper mixing, followed
by brief centrifugation (~2 sec).

Appendix D3: Illumina Run Configuration
If unique dual indexes (UDIs) instead of sublibrary index primers were used for
indexing, see Section 4.1. Otherwise, use the following single index Illumina run
configuration and sequence information.
Evercode sequencing libraries should be diluted and denatured according to the
instruction for the relevant sequencing instrument. We strongly recommended adding
5% PhiX for optimal sequencing quality. Libraries should be sequenced with paired reads
using the following read structure.
