-O marina cultures in F/2 medium supplemented with heat inactivated bacteria. The
cultures were maintained with the heat inactivated bacteria supplanted every week with
an extra addition an hour prior to the transfection.  (It has not been tested yet if this
addition one hour before the transfection is critical or not).
-ULYISIS Nucleic acid labeling kit (Molecular Probes, Cat # U21650). This kit is used to
prepare the DNA and label it with a fluorophore. In our case, we used the ULYSIS Alexa
488 labeling kit.
-Transfection reagents
2.5 M CaCl2
2XHEBS (274 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 1.4 mM Na2HPO4, 15 mM D-glucose, 42 mM HEPES
(free acid), pH 7.10
HBS0/2: 144 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM HEPES pH 6.7 (alternatively other
protocols use PBS pH 7.4). It was also possible to see the transfection with no washes.

Use only fragments that are 100 bp to 1000 bp
Long DNA can be degraged with DNAse into fragments 100 to 1000 bp. The ULYSIS kit
includes DNAse and a protocol to produce fragments in that range. Alternative PCR
products can be used. The labelling kit suggests not to use longer fragments to avoid
precipitation of the labelled fragments.
For labeling 1 ug of DNA, cleaned PCR products or DNA fragments should be precipitated
in 3M sodium acetate (pH5.2) and two volumes of absolute ethanol, freeze at -70 °C for
30 min and then for 15 min at 12,000 g. Wash the pellet with 70 % ethanol and allow it to
air dry. Resuspend the pellet in 20 ul of the labeling buffer from the ULYSIS kit.
Alternatively I have eluted the PCR products from the mini column in 30 ul of the labelling
buffer form the ULYISIS kit.

The following two steps were performed exactly as indicated in the instruction manual of
the kit. It was up scaled to label 5 ug of DNA
Denature the DNA at 95 °C for 5 min and then snap cool on ice. Centrifuge the tube
briefly to redeposit the sample to the bottom of the tube
Add 1 ul of Alexa fluo Ulysis reagent per ug of DNA
Materials used:
1. Prepare DNA for labelling.
2. Label the DNA

Incubate at 80 °C for 15 min. Stop the reaction by placing the tube on ice. Centrifuge
briefly

Purify the product from the excess of free ULS labelling reagent using a gel filtration-
based spin column. The instructions recommend Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin ®P-30 or
Princeton Separations Centri-Sep. I used Zeba spin desalting columns (Zeba, Thermo
Scientific, cat # 89882)

-Prepare DNA/CaCl2 mix for transfection of 1 ml of dense culture:
DNA                             1-8 ug
2.5 M CaCl2                          5 ul
Nuclease free H2O      to 50 ul final volume
If there is a desire to increase the amounts of DNA to 3-24  ug , the CaCl2 should be
increased to 15 ul and the final volume to 150 ml.
-Mix the DNA/CaCl2 with equal volumes of HeBS. IMPORTANT: add 1/10th of the
volumes of the DNA/CaCl2 mix at a time mixing well by vortexing 3 s after each addition.
This gradual mixing avoids local over concentrations of CaCl2, which creates an
unevenly sized precipitate. Supposedly, only very fine precipitate is efficiently taken up
by the cells.
-Incubate 20 min at RT
-Add 800-1000 ul of O marina culture
-Incubate at RT. Image at different time points. I saw the fluorescence after about 4-5
and collected images 24 h later.
-The efficiency seems to be 30-40 % but a lot of them show fluorescence in the nucleus,
suggesting that this could be potentially an appropriate method to generate stable
transfected O marina.
-There is a wash step in which the cells are supposed to be rinsed with HBS0/2 three
times and then resuspended in their medium but I noticed a lot of cell damage with
centrifugation so I skipped the washes and did a dilution in F/2 medium in half the first
day.
3. Purify the labelled DNA fr the free ULS labelling reagent
