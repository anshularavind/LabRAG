Abstract
This protocol details a modified RNA extraction method that combines CTAB-based purification with Qiagen
RNeasy column cleanup, specifically tailored for complex plant tissues like cannabis, which harbor high levels
of secondary metabolites and polysaccharides. The CTAB extraction step effectively eliminates contaminants
that could impede downstream applications, ensuring high RNA integrity. The following Qiagen cleanup step
further improves RNA purity, resulting in high-quality RNA suitable for RT-qPCR, RNA sequencing, and various
molecular biology applications. This protocol especially benefits researchers working with medicinal plants,
recalcitrant species, or tissues rich in secondary metabolites. The comparative table provided in this protocol
showcases key optimizations, contrasts this method with previously published techniques, and offers
suggested adjustments for further refinements.

Guidelines
This protocol combines CTAB-based RNA extraction for removing polysaccharides and secondary metabolites
with Qiagen RNeasy column purification for high-purity RNA.
Work quickly but carefully to prevent RNA degradation—keep samples frozen in LN₂ whenever possible.
Use fresh reagents and pre-warm CTAB buffer to 65°C before starting.
Maintain an RNase-free environment by cleaning surfaces with RNaseZap and using filtered RNase-free
pipette tips.
Do not overload columns—follow recommended sample volumes to avoid clogging.

23
Wash the pellet with 1 mL of 75% ethanol. Invert the tube 5–6 times. The goal is to
ensure the RNA pellet is well-washed without disrupting it. DO NOT VORTEX

briefly)
29
Pass the sample through a QIAshredder spin column (lilac) placed in a 2 mL collection
tube. Centrifuge at ≥8000 x g for 2 min. 
30
Carefully transfer the cleared lysate (~400 µL flow-through) to a new tube, avoiding
any visible pellet at the bottom. Discard the QIAshredder  column.
31

ethanol).
42
Place the RNeasy spin column in a new 2 mL collection tube. Centrifuge at full speed
(≥10,000 rpm) for 1 min (ensures ethanol removal).
43
Transfer the RNeasy spin column to a new 1.5 mL RNase-free tube.
44
