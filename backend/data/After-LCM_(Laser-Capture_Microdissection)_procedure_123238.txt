After completing the LCM intended, lift the cap as instructed by the manufacturer, and
assess the completeness of the capture by inspecting both the microdissected tissue
attached to the cap, as well as the section dissected.
Note
NOTE: If debris or nonspecific tissue is adhered to the cap, gently press the cap onto a
post-it note to eliminate contamination source. 
2
Use the insertion tool (Arcturus LCM Cap Insertion Tool, Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) to
transfer the cap from the LCM device to a 0.5-ml RNase-free microcentrifuge tube
(N8010611, Applied BioSystems, CA, USA) containing 
50 µL  of lysis buffer
(Arcturus® PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit, Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) in accordance to
the Macro Cap protocol of the manufacturer (http://
tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals /1268200.pdf). 
3
Invert the cap–tube assembly, flick to ensure complete coverage of the cap surface
by the extraction buffer. 
Incubate at 
42 °C  for 
00:30:00  using the preheated incubation block, and
then spin briefly to collect cell extract. 
4
Discard the cap, save the tube with the cell extract, and immediately freeze the extract at
-80 °C . 
Note
Critical Step: RNA should be immediately extracted after LCM completion, and the
microdissected cells should be collected in a contamination-free and non-contact manner.
5
Pooling: Combine the extracts from homogeneous cell populations captured on four
caps, using the MCC tissues of the same animal, onto a single RNA purification column
to achieve a sufficient yield of RNA.

Note
NOTE: Each LCM sample is prepared by pooling the cell extract of 4 caps containing
microdissected cells procured from the same zone in 24 tissue sections mounted on 4
slides (6 sections/slide). However, 8 caps are pooled together to prepare one LCM sample
of FZ as this zone is very small in size. 
6
In accordance to the manufacturer’s instructions, 
first mix the pooled cell extract with 70% ethanol, and load onto a preconditioned
purification column. 
7
Spin the column and wash it twice with wash buffer.
8
Then, elute the RNA. 
Note
However, some modifications are recommended:
adjustment of the 70% ethanol volume to compensate for the total volume of the
pooled sample (
200 µL ), resulting in a combined volume of the cell
extract/ethanol mix of approximately 
400 µL . Since the loading capacity of the
columns used is 
300 µL , the cell extract/ethanol mix is transferred in two steps
where 
200 µL  is loaded in each step. 
On-column DNase treatment (RNase-Free DNase Set, Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany)
is done regularly for all samples as the elimination of genomic DNA is critical for
accurate downstream applications. This is done between the two washes of the
column, and according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 
Also, the additional 
00:01:00  re-centrifugation of the column (to ensure removal
of the wash buffer before elution step) is regularly carried out.

To measure the 3'/m ratio of GAPDH and β-Actin, firstly design two primers sets one
specific for the 3'end, and the other one for the middle (m) region of each
housekeeping gene (Table 1).

Note
For minute LCM-RNA samples, conventional methods applied to assess RNA quality have
a tendency to produce inconsistent and imprecise results. Alternatively, qRT-PCR analysis
to calculate the 3′/ m ratio for housekeeping genes is suggested as a metric measure to
evaluate qualitative performance of small RNA samples.
10
Use isolated total RNA samples as a template to synthesize first-strand cDNA
according to the manufacturer's instructions via reverse transcription process, using
Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and oligo (dT) [12–18]
(Invitrogen, CA, USA) (http://
tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/superscriptIII_man.pdf). 
10 µL  to 
11 µL  of each LCM-RNA samples is used per 
20 µL  cDNA
synthesis reaction using Veriti 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).
11
For each primer pair, generate a standard curve with serial dilutions of cDNA synthesized
by reverse transcription of total RNA isolated from a mixture of MCC specimens in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit,
Qiagen, GmbH, Hilden, Germany) (http://www.qiagen .com/us/resources/
resourcedetail?id=8039840d-4815-4375-8933-bc09247e47c0 &lang =en). 
12
Perform qRT-PCR using a Step One Plus RT PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA)
and Power SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). 
The parameters of thermal cycle are set as follows:

40 cycles of denaturation at 
95 °C  for 
00:00:15
and annealing and extension at 
60 °C  for

13
To generate dissociation curves the reactions are
denaturation at 
95 °C  for 
00:00:15
annealing at 
60 °C  for 
00:01:00 , 
followed by a gradual increase in temperature (0.3% ramp rate) to 
95 °C . 
14
Also generate melting curves to assess PCR specificity. 
Determine relative quantity for the four tested regions by utilizing the corresponding
standard curves generated in the same experiment, and then the 3'/ m ratio is
calculated for each sample.
Note
NOTE:  The 3′/m ratio for a gene measures the abundance of that gene at the 3′ end to the
abundance at the midregion. In the presence of nondegraded full-length transcripts, the
two quantities at the 3′ and midregions are almost equal, resulting in a ratio close to 1,
whereas shortened/degraded transcripts show less PCR amplification at (m) region and
hence higher 3′/m ratio (Kube et al. 2007) There are no fixed cut-off values for the 3′/m
ratio, as different studies could tolerate different ratios, however, in general a cut-off value
of ≤2 have been chosen.
15
Apply the LCM protocol described above to collect total RNA from the four zones of MCC
individually. 
16
Then, prepare samples that meet quality requirements for subsequent molecular
analyses. 
17
In case of microarray analysis, use LCM-RNA samples as input material for a two-cycle
linear amplification process, producing amplified aRNA samples which are then Biotin-
labeled and fragmented before performing microarray hybridization.

Use 
11 µL  of each total RNA sample as input material for a two-cycle linear
amplification process in accordance to the protocol provided with the Arcturus®
RiboAmp® HS Plus amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA)
(https://tools.lifetechnologies.com/ content/sfs/manuals/cms_085206.pdf ), but with
only one modification in the last step of the protocol (aRNA purification). 
19
Concurrently, amplify a 
10 µL  sample (
500 pg  of total RNA) from the RNA
control provided with the kit to verify the efficiency of amplification. 
20
Perform two cycles of linear amplification, each cycle consists of five steps:
20.1
First strand synthesis reaction: 
Add 
1 µL  of oligo(dT) primer incorporating a T7 promoter sequence to the total
RNA sample (approx. 11μl), then incubate for 
00:05:00  at 
65 °C . 
Follow this by adding the first strand cDNA components provided with the kit,
together with SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, CA, USA), and
incubating the mix for 
01:00:00  at 
42 °C . 
At this point, remove  
2 µL  of each sample to assess the integrity of the starting
mRNA by evaluating the 3'/m ratio of GAPDH and β- Actin housekeeping genes via
the qRT-PCR assay as described in section "Evaluation of RNA Integrity".
20.2
Second strand synthesis reaction: 
Add 
1 µL  of exogenous primer, followed by incubation for 
00:02:00  at 
95 °C .
Then, add second strand cDNA components and incubate as instructed to produce
double-stranded cDNA.
20.3
cDNA purification: 
Use MiraCol™ purification columns and wash the cDNA.
Elute it with the buffers provided.
20.4
In vitro transcription: 
Add IVT components including T7 RNA polymerase, followed by incubation for 
06:00:00  at 
42 °C  using Veriti 96 well thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, CA,
USA) to yield antisense RNA (aRNA).
20.5
aRNA purification: After performing the DNase step according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, use MiraCol purification columns (together with the buffers provided) to

purify the resulting amplified aRNA, and eventually elute it in 
12 µL  volume of the
elution buffer. 
21
In the second cycle of amplification, incubate the purified product of the first cycle
with random primers for 
00:05:00  at 
65 °C .
Then utilize SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase to synthesize first-strand cDNA. 
Carry out the remaining four processes of the second cycle as described in the kit
protocol with only one modification. Reduce the volume of the eluting buffer from 
30 µL  to 
15 µL , followed by a second elution step utilizing another 
15 µL  and another tube. 
Note
NOTE: This is recommended to obtain higher cRNA concentrations during the first elution,
thus eliminating the need to concentrate diluted samples (if any) with vacuum centrifuge.
After that, quality control measurements are employed to determine both the mRNA
transcript length using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a total RNA 6000 Nano-lab-Chip
(Agilent technologies, CA, USA), as well as RNA purity via a NanoDrop 2000c
spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) where a ratio of two optical densities; A260 and
A280 is calculated. 
2 µL  of each sample is diluted to 
6 µL , and then divided
into two aliquots of 
3 µL . One for the Bioanalyzer profile, and the other aliquot is
used to measure sample concentration and purity (OD 260/280) using the Nanodrop.
22
Calculate amplification efficiency of the performed linear amplification by dividing the
yield of the RNA control sample after the amplification step by the initial RNA input. 
Utilize the remaining 
13 µL  of the first elution for labeling and microarray
hybridization, while the products of second elution are stored at 
-70 °C .
23
Perform Labeling of aRNA transcripts using the Arcturus® Turbo Labeling™ Biotin
Reagent Kit (Applied Biosystems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and in accordance to
the manufacturer’s instructions (https://tools.lifetechnologies.com/
content/sfs/manuals/cms_085525.pd f ), but with minor modifications. 
23.1
Firstly, increase the amount of aRNA input to 
25 µg  instead of 
1-20 µg  range
recommended by the manufacturer.

23.2
Secondly, add extra 
5 µL  of nuclease-free water to the same column after the first
elution of labeled aRNA (as recommended by Pietersen et al. 2009), so that the final
volume is 
25 µL . 
Note
NOTE: These modifications are considered to ensure the availability of enough labeled
aRNA quantities for the subsequent fragmentation and hybridization procedure, also, to
account for the volumes needed for quantifying the yielded labeled aRNA, and for
assessing the quality of fragmented product later on. 
24
The protocol for labeling, in brief, is as the following: 
24.1
Adjust the volume of 
25 µg  of each aRNA sample to a total of 
13 µL . 
Then, prepare the reaction mix for labeling (
20 µL  in total) and incubate as
described in the protocol of the kit. 
24.2
Resuspend the columns provided with the kit and wash it as instructed.
24.3
Remove the excess/free biotin label, and then add 
5 µL  of nuclease-free water to
the same column, followed by centrifugation for 
00:01:00 , producing a final
volume of 
25 µL . 
Quantify the amount of biotin-labeled aRNA using the Nanodrop. 
25
Note
Critical: Fragmentation of aRNA is critical for microarray hybridization. The amount of
aRNA needed depends on the GeneChip array format, for instance, the 64 Array Format
needs 15 μg of aRNA. 
NOTE: Fragmentation buffer (5X) of the GeneChip® 3' IVT Express Kit (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) is used to prepare the samples.

The protocol followed is in the accordance to the Arcturus® Turbo Labeling™ Kit with
Biotin manufacturer’s instructions (https://
tools.lifetechnologies.com/content/sfs/manuals/cms_085525.pdf), but with
modification to the total fragmentation mix volume. 
Increase the total volume from 
25 µL  (
15 µg  labeled aRNA in 
20 µL  + 
5 µL  of 5X fragmentation buffer) to 
28 µL  (
16.8 µg  labeled aRNA in 
22.4 µL  + 
5.6 µL  of 5X fragmentation buffer) while maintaining a 4:1 ratio of
the two components of the mix. 
This is to account for the volume needed for the optional Bioanalyzer evaluation to
analyze the size of the products after incubating the mix at 
94 °C  for 
00:10:00 , while an aliquot of 
12.5 µg  of fragmented and labeled aRNA in 
25 µL  is saved for preparation of hybridization mix.
