Guidelines
Transformation Protocol Variables
Thawing: Cells are best thawed on ice and DNA added as soon as the last bit of ice in the tube disappears. Cells
can also be thawed by hand, but warming above 0°C will decrease the transformation efficiency.
Incubation of DNA with Cells on Ice: For maximum transformation efficiency, cells and DNA should be incubated
together on ice for 30 minutes. Expect a 2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 10 minutes this step is
shortened.
Heat Shock: Both the temperature and the timing of the heat shock step are important and specific to the
transformation volume and vessel. Using the transformation tube provided, 30 seconds at 42°C is optimal.
Outgrowth: Outgrowth at 37°C for 1 hour is best for cell recovery and for expression of antibiotic resistance.
Expect a 2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 15 minutes this step is shortened. SOC gives 2-fold
higher transformation efficiency than LB medium; and incubation with shaking or rotating the tube gives 2-fold
higher transformation efficiency than incubation without shaking.
Plating: Selection plates can be used warm or cold, wet or dry without significantly affecting the transformation
efficiency. However, warm, dry plates are easier to spread and allow for the most rapid colony formation.

* Ideally, DNA for transformation should be purified and resuspended in water or TE. However, up to 10 µl of DNA
directly from a ligation mix can be used with only a two-fold loss of transformation efficiency. Where it is necessary to
maximize the number of transformants (e.g. a library), a purification step, either a spin column or phenol/chloroform
extraction and ethanol precipitation should be added.

1
Please select whether you have C3019H or C3019I cells.
2
Thaw a tube of NEB 10-beta Competent E. coli cells 
On ice  for 
00:10:00 .
Note
Cells are best thawed on ice and DNA added as soon as the last bit of ice in the tube
disappears. Cells can also be thawed by hand, but warming above 0°C will decrease the
transformation efficiency.
3
Add 
1 µL -
5 µL  containing 
1 pg -
100 ng plasmid DNA  to the cell
mixture.
4
Carefully flick the tube 4-5 times to mix cells and DNA. Do not vortex.
5
Place the mixture 
On ice  for 
00:30:00 . Do not mix. 
Note
For maximum transformation efficiency, cells and DNA should be incubated together on
ice for 30 minutes. Expect a 2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 10 minutes
this step is shortened.
6
Heat shock at exactly 
42 °C  for exactly 
00:00:30 . Do not mix. 
Note
Both the temperature and the timing of the heat shock step are important and specific to
the transformation volume and vessel. Using the transformation tube provided, 30
seconds at 42°C is optimal.

7
Place 
On ice  for 
00:05:00 . Do not mix. 
8
Pipette 
950 µL room temperature NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium  into the
mixture. 
Note
NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium gives 2-fold higher transformation efficiency than
LB medium.
9
Place at 
37 °C  for 
01:00:00 , shaking vigorously (
250 rpm ) or rotating. 
Note
Outgrowth at 37°C for 1 hour is best for cell recovery and for expression of antibiotic
resistance. Expect a 2-fold loss in transformation efficiency for every 15 minutes this step
is shortened. Incubation with shaking or rotating the tube gives 2-fold higher
transformation efficiency than incubation without shaking.
10
Warm selection plates to 
37 °C .  
Note
Selection plates can be used warm or cold, wet or dry without significantly affecting the
transformation efficiency. However, warm, dry plates are easier to spread and allow for the
most rapid colony formation.
11
Mix the cells thoroughly by flicking the tube and inverting.
12
Perform several 10-fold serial dilutions in NEB 10-beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium.
Note
Please note that NEB no longer recommends SOC for use in this protocol. NEB 10-
beta/Stable Outgrowth Medium is now provided with NEB 10-beta Competent E.coli and
available also as a stand-alone product.
13
Spread 
50 µL -
100 µL  of each dilution onto a selection plate.

Incubate 
Overnight  at 
37 °C .
Note
Alternatively, incubate at 
30 °C   for 24-36 hours or 
25 °C  for 
48:00:00 .
