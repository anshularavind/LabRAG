Abstract
This Standard Operation Procedure is intended to guide the facility staff to perform scheduled maintenance and
cleaning of the instrument BD FACSDiscover S8
.
Guidelines
This protocol should be followed:
Preventively every 15 days.
After running potentially bacterial loaded samples.
When a bacterial/fungal contamination is detected in the weekly assessment.
Perform the steps subsequently unless otherwise stated.
Materials
1. Autoclaved and mounted sheath-tank (with the sensor).
2. Autoclaved lab kitchen distilled H2O bottles.
3. Cleaning box.
4. Incidin Foam.
5. 70% Ethanol.
6. Distilled H2O in a 50 mL tube.
7. FACS Clean.

Step 3.1
Safety warnings
Handle FACSClean carefully. It should't enter in contact with the skin and eyes (wear gloves, lab coat
and glasses) and it ruins colorful clothes.
Before start
Be sure to wear gloves and lab coat at all times! 
General rule: spray 70% ethanol in all connectors before plugging any tubing!

1
Switch on the PC, the instrument and then the FACSChorus software
2
Pull the fluidics cart, unplug the waste tank, discard it's contents and reconnect it
3
Go to: Run Extended Fluidics Startup
3.1
On the step 4, fill the water bottle with 
FACSClean Becton Dickinson (BD) Catalog #340345
 instead of distilled H2O.
Wait for 
00:15:00 and then proceed to the next step
Safety information
Wear protective clothes, gloves and glasses every time FACSClean is handled in this
protocol.
3.2
On step 5, don't connect the sheath tank!
4
Prepare the sheath tank for autoclaving and send it immediately to the lab kitchen
5
Rinse the distilled H2O bottle to remove the FACSClean, then fill all bottles with its
respective solutions
6
Go to Cytometer: System Startup - Prepare for aseptic sort
7
In the meantime of the Aseptic cleaning, remove the parts for cleaning and put them in
the Cleaning Compartment box.
7.1
Spray Incidin Foam on the following parts: tube holder and splash shield
7.2
Spray carefully the entire sort chamber (use first 
MAXX Windus C2 ECOLAB Catalog #9084640
 to remove the salt crystals, then
after some minutes follow with 70% Ethanol) and dry it with soft tissue paper.

On the last step, put the newly autoclaved and fully filled sheath tank in the fluidics cart.
Connect the air connection to the sheath tank. Connect the sheath tank sensor.
10
Change the connections from the clean port to the sheath tank. Plug the bypassed
connections to the sheath filter. Start the last step.

After the Aseptic Cleaning is done, remove the closed loop nozzle and put into the 50 mL
tube containing DI H2O.
11.1
Remove the nozzle lock, put into the Clean Compartment box and spray 
Incidin Foam ECOLAB Catalog #3046010
 over it.
11.2
Soak Q-tips with 
Incidin Foam ECOLAB Catalog #3046010
 and insert them into
the nozzle slot and nozzle lock slot. Wait for

Clean all the parts in the box with 70% Ethanol and re-install them
13
Remove the Q-tips, clean and dry both the closed loop nozzle and the nozzle lock and
re-install them
14
Perform an Extended Fluidics Startup
15
Grease the O-ring of the sample pressure chamber (by greasing the socket of the tube
holder)
16
Purge the sheath filter 2x
17
Insert the desired nozzle and start the stream
