1
Resuspend the sgRNA overnight at 4C in TE buffer at a concentration of
4 µg/µL
2
Resuspend the Alt-R HDR modified ssODN overnight in D-PBS at a concentration of 
200 pmol/ul
3
For each nucleofection, prepare 6ml StemFlex + Revitacell or Rock inhibitor and  coat 1x
6-well plate with geltrex/synthemax/matrigel for 
01:00:00  at 
37 °C
4
For each nucleofection, prepare complete P3 solution by adding 
20 µL  of
Supplement to 
90 µL    of P3 solition in a 1.5ml Eppendorf
5
For each nucleofection, mix 
4 µL  of sgRNA (
16 µg   total) and 
2 µL  of
recombinant Cas9 protein (
20 µg  total), in 1.5ml Eppendorf tube
6
Incubate at RT for 
00:30:00   to 
00:45:00 . Note: begin harvesting iPSC
after 15mins
7
Immediately prior to nucleofection, add 
1 µL   (
200 pmol ) of Alt-R HDR modified
ssODN to the pre-assembled Cas9 RNP.
8
Switch on the nucleofector unit and select “X-unit” and single cuvette. Use the “Primary
Cell P3” program and set the pulse code to “CA-137”
9
Collect the iPSC from an 80% confluent well with pre-warmed accutase. Count cells and
pellet 8 x 105 cells by centrifuging at 
300 x g, 20°C, 00:05:00   and aspirate
supernatant.

B. Pre-assembly of Cas9 RNP

10
While the cells are spinning, add the 
1 µL  of ssODN to the pre-assembled Cas9 RNP
Eppendorf. 
11
After pelleting cells and supernatant removed, gently resuspend the cell pellet in 
100 µL  complete P3 Solution and transfer the cells to the Eppendorf containing
Cas9 RNP+ssODN. Transfer the cell suspension to the nucleocuvette. Tap the cuvette on
a flat surface to eliminate bubbles and nucleofect immediately using the “Primary Cell
P3” program and “CA-137” pulse code. 
12
Immediately after the nuclefection, transfer the cells into one well of pre-coated, warm
6-well plate containing 2-3 ml of Stemflex + revitacell/Rock. Inh. 
13
Add HDR enhancer to a final concentration of 
30 micromolar (µM)  (1:100 from the
3mM stock
solution). Culture the cells in a 
32 °C  incubator (cold shock for 2 days: important for
homozygous gene editing).
14
Change media the next day to StemFlex without revitacell/rock inh and HDR enhancer
15
Return cells to 
37 °C   incubator on day 3
16
Once the cells in the 6-well plate are 80% confluent, dissociate them with accutase into
a single cell suspension, centrifuge at 
210 x g, 20°C, 00:05:00 . Remove
supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in StemFlex + revitacel/rock.inh
17
Count the cells and plate between 800 – 1000 single cells in geltrex/synthemax/matrigel-
coated 10cm
petri dishes containing 10ml Stemflex + revitacel/rock inh.
18
Transfer cells to 
37 °C  incubator.
19
Change the media the next day and daily with Stemflex to remove revitacell/rock inhibitor

With the aid of a dissecting microscope and a p200, individual colonies are picked and
transferred into 2x 96-well plates, one for colonies expansion, the other for DNA lysis
and genotyping. 
21
For each 96 colonies to be picked, prepare 1x geltrex coated 96-well and 15ml of
Stemflex+Rock inh/revitacell and warm to RT in the hood.
22
Use the p200 tip to break apart the colony from the plate and collect the cell fragments
in a volume of 
50 µL   of media. Transfer each colony to a well of a U-bottom 96-
well plate.
23
Once 96 colonies are picked, add 
150 µL  of Stemflex+rock inh/revitacell to each
well of the U-bottom plate with a multichannel.
24
With the use of the multichannel set to 100ul, pipette cells up and down 10 times in the
U-bottom plate. Transfer 
100 µL  of the cell suspension to geltrex coated 96-well
plate (for colony expansion) and 
100 µL   to 96-well plate for lysis and DNA
extraction.
25
The following day, replace the media in the expansion 96-well plate with fresh Stemflex
without revitacell/rock inh.
26
For each 96-well plate to be lysed, add 
10 mg  of proteinase K powder (Sigma-
Aldrich, P6556) to 
10 mL   of lysis buffer (
50 millimolar (mM)  KCl, 
10 millimolar (mM)  Tris-HCl pH 8, 
2 millimolar (mM)  MgCl2, 
0.45 % volume  (v/v) NP40, 
0.45 % volume  (v/v) Tween20).
27
With a multichannel pipettor, remove media from confluent wells of the Synthemax-
coated 96-well plate and wash each well once with 
150 µL   room temperature D-
PBS.

F. Genomic DNA extraction from 96-well plates

28
Add 
100 µL  of lysis buffer containing 1 mg/ml proteinase K, seal the 96-well plate
andcincubate at 
60 °C  for at least 
04:00:00  .
29
While the plate is still warm, transfer lysates to a 96-well PCR plate, seal the plate and
heat inactivate the proteinase K by incubating the plate at 
95 °C  for 
00:10:00
in a thermocycler.
30
While the samples are warm, prepare a 1:20 dilution of the lysates in water for setting
up PCR reactions. Store the undiluted lysates at 
-80 °C  . The diluted samples
can be kept at 
4 °C   for a few days.
