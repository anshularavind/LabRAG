Abstract
This is a protocol for transfection of H4 (Human Brain Neuroglioma) in either 10% or 100% FBS using FuGENE HD.

1
Cell plating
H4 (neuroglioma) cells were seeded from 90-100% confluent culture the day before
transfection with the density 7,000 cells/well in 100μl complete growth medium (DMEM +
10% Fetal Bovine Serum).
For transfection in 100% Fetal Bovine Serum the complete growth medium was replaced
with Fetal Bovine Serum two hours before transfection.
2
Complex preparation (per 20 wells)
Tissue culture 96-round bottom well plates were used for complex preparation:
3
Prepare 0.02μg/μl pCMVβ DNA solution in OptiMEM® or sterile deionized water.
4
Add 6 μl of reagent to 100 μl of DNA solution.
5
Mix carefully by pipetting (15 times).
6
Incubate 10 min at room temperature.
7
Add 5 μl of complex per well to the cells, and mix thoroughly.
8
Incubation
Incubate transfected cells in CO2 incubator for 48 hours.
9
Detection of β-gal expression
1. Remove the medium from the well and wash the cells once with 100μl per well PBS.
10
Fix the cells in the well with 50μl solution of 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 5min at room
temperature.
11
Wash each well twice with 100μl PBS.

12
Add 50μl per well of substrate/stain solution and incubate the plate overnight at 37°C.
13
Observe the cells under microscope and evaluate the proportion of blue (β-gal-positive)
cells.
