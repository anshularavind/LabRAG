Abstract
Version 5 Updates: 
Release of updated primer scheme (v1.1) that includes 11 additional primers to be spiked into the original primer
scheme to improve coverage when sequencing clade I viruses. See materials tab for primer information and
step 8 for new clade I reference and BED files. 
Complete validation study: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.10.14.22280783
Background: The current global outbreak of human Monkeypox virus (hMPXV) concurrent with an ongoing
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has further highlighted the need for genomic surveillance and pathogen whole genome
sequencing. While metagenomic and hybrid capture sequencing approaches were used to sequence many of
the early mpox cases, the viability of these methods is dependent on samples with high viral DNA
concentrations. Given the atypical clinical presentation of cases associated with the current outbreak and
uncertainty regarding viral load across both the course of infection and anatomical body sites, there is a strong
need for a more sensitive and broadly applicable sequencing approach. Amplicon-based sequencing
(PrimalSeq) was initially developed for sequencing of Zika virus, and later adapted as the main sequencing
approach for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we used PrimalScheme to design a primer scheme for hMPXV and we
validated it with widely used SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocols. Based on initial validation, our approach
shows notably higher depth and breadth of coverage across the genome, particularly with higher PCR cycle
threshold (Ct) samples, as compared to metagenomic sequencing. While further testing is needed, the early
success of this approach has significant implications for sequencing efforts of the current hMPXV outbreak
and serves as a proof of concept of amplicon-based sequencing for use with other large-genome DNA viruses
and potentially bacterial genomes.
Overview of Design: We used PrimalScheme (https://primalscheme.com/) to generate an hMPXV primer
scheme using a pre-outbreak A.1 lineage reference genome (GenBank accession: MT903345). The primer
scheme comprises a total of 163 primer pairs with an amplicon length ranging between 1597 and 2497 bp
(average length of 1977 bp). The primer scheme is compatible with current ARTIC and COVIDSeq SARS-CoV-2
sequencing protocols, and while validated only with Illumina library prep methods and sequencing platforms, it
would likely see a high degree of success with other sequencing platforms such as the Oxford Nanopore
Technologies MinION. 
Initial Validation: We validated our hMPXV primer scheme with clinical specimens at the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health, Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory under the IRB Project Titled “Rash
Illness: Alternate Specimen Types and Sequencing” (protocol number 1917413). A total of 25 clinical specimens
were included in this initial validation comprised of both throat and swabs of fluid from lesions of 8 individuals,
belonging to the current outbreak-associated hMPXV B.1 lineage as determined by prior characterization at the
Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Ct values were determined with the non-variola orthopox
diagnostic qPCR assay developed for use by the Laboratory Response Network (Rapid Diagnostic Testing for
Response to the Monkeypox Outbreak — Laboratory Response Network, United States, May 17–June 30,
2022 | MMWR (cdc.gov)). Clinical samples ranged in cycle threshold (Ct) values from 15.03 (high viral
concentration) to 34.63 (low viral concentration), and each sample was sequenced in parallel using a

metagenomics approach and the provided amplicon-based approach. Extractions and sequencing analysis
were performed in accordance with current biosafety guidance including extraction in a BSL-3 setting. An
evaluation of site-specific biosafety practices should be developed in consultation with your organization’s
biosafety officer. Libraries were prepared with the Illumina DNA prep kit and sequenced on the MiSeq (v2 kit
running 2x150 nt reads). Consensus genomes were generated at 10X coverage using the TheiaCoV_Illumina_PE
Workflow Series on Terra.bio. An hMPXV “fork” was developed for us by Curtis Kapsak from Theiagen, which
included the hMPXV reference sequence, primer scheme, and consensus genome length, and can currently be
accessed at: https://github.com/theiagen/public_health_viral_genomics/tree/cjk-MPXV-theiacov. We found
comparable genome coverage between amplicon and metagenomic sequencing with low Ct (<18) samples, yet
a significant increase in genome coverage with amplicon sequencing in higher Ct samples (>18; Figure 1A.)
The library clean up stage of the amplicon based Illumina DNA prep protocol was conducted using the
‘standard DNA input’ option for comparison to metagenomics. Following optimization with 15 additional paired
samples unrelated to the initial 10 samples, we found improved genome coverage with higher Ct samples (>25)
using the ‘small PCR amplicon input’ option of the Illumina DNA prep protocol (Figure 1B.) Our findings
highlight how amplicon-based approaches can significantly expand hMPXV sequencing to a wider variety of
samples.

Amongst samples with a low Ct (<18), genome coverage via amplicon sequencing was consistently >97%, with
minimal amplicon drop-outs (Figure 2). Amplicons 11, 75, and 118 showed consistent drop-out across the
sequenced samples, while none of the primers had mismatches, except for a single nucleotide mismatch in the
11_RIGHT primer. We did obtain coverage for these amplicons when sequencing clade IIa DNA from cultured
virus (strain USA-2003; NR-4928) obtained from BEI Resources (NIAID, NIH). This suggests that the dropouts
of these primers may be a specific issue related to the current hMPXV B.1 lineage genomes. As this protocol is
still in development, we will further investigate performance as we continue to sequence additional samples.

Conclusion: We developed an amplicon-based sequencing (PrimalSeq) approach for hMPXV that improved
the depth and breadth of genome coverage with low viral concentration specimens as compared to
metagenomic sequencing.
This protocol represents the fourth iteration of development. Further versions will be uploaded to protocols.io
with an accompanying description of changes as appropriate.

primers and spike into existing primer pools (5 odd numbered primers to be added to pool 1 and 6 even numbered
primers to be added to pool 2) at equal primer concentrations.

Before start
This protocol is currently in the developmental phase. It is for research purposes only and should not be used in a
diagnostic capacity. 
If using clinical samples, DNA will need to be extracted and purified prior to beginning library preparation.
Primer diluting and pooling requires several hours and may be conducted well in advance so long as the pooled
primers are stored at -20°C.
Following primer dilution and pooling, this workflow can be completed in one day, however, it is recommended to
be conducted across two, with the amplicon generation step on the first day and all subsequent wet-lab steps on
the second day. 
Protocol Recommendations:
To maximize sequencing coverage, we recommend the following best practices based on our multi-site validation
study: 
1. Prioritizing samples with cycle threshold (Ct) values <29 if resources are limited
2. Generating at least 1 million sequencing reads per sample
